        <h2>An interesting new club</h2>
        <img class="halfimg" src="sigapp_upscaled.png">
        <h4>What is ACM SIGAPP?</h4>
        <p>The new club that I'm interested in is called *drumroll* ACM SIGAPP. I found them from mention of a member of the IGDC club. Reading directly from their website,
          (https://sigapp.club/), They are the "Special Interest Group - Application in applied computing." What this really means is that they are a software engineering focused club. 
          As of writing, I have gone to one 1-hour meeting and met the current team and found that I liked their atmosphere and that they were all quite knowledgeable.
        </p>

        <h4>Safewalk</h4>
        <p>The current main project that they are working on is called Safewalk. In Purdue, the local police station has a program that allows for you to call a special safewalk number to request
          a police officer walk you home. I'm sure this is a fairly common local police program. 2 years ago, the local police station reached out to SIGAPP to develop a program that extends this.
          The idea was to have a phone app that allowed you to press a button and send your location and personal info to a internet server where the police officers could look at a website and assign a police officer
           to carry out a walk, displayed on a map. It appears the development of the project has been a bit rocky with all of the original students that were working on the project already graduating. The project uses 
           React for it's web portion, Flutter for the application portion and Rest API for the server portion. Consequently, the SIGAPP team split up into 3 smaller teams to work on each individual portion. 
           I wanted to learn more about React and their members offered to teach me what they knew, despite admitting that the web portion was their weakest team.

      <div class="textleft" id="Topic2">
        <h2>A tricky challenge</h2>
        <h4>The state at the start</h4>
        <p>It's never easy to get on-boarded into a new codebase, especially for someone like me who isn't exactly experienced. It took me and the SIGAPP team over two hours to even setup and build their react site and deploy it on localhost.
          At first, I was pretty confused at just about the entire structure and code of the project. There wasn't much more documentation then a few line comments per file, and there were dozens of files and imports. After looking at it for a few more days,
           I can confidently say I am still confused, but slightly less then before. To my best guess, the general format is based off of the npx create-react-app command, where there is one almost empty index.html file, and react 
           is used to create literally everything else from page to individual widgets. Each page has it's own files and each widget also has it's own files. In total, I'm looking at over 50 files, and over 20 .js files. Having very little react experience, 
           could barely even track the flow of data or what a block of code even does. (It's formatted very differently from languages like C# or Python. There are lambda operators and react-specific synatax everywhere.) Luckily, the SIGAPP group seems pretty knowledgeable 
           in basic aspects like this. Over the next few weeks, I'm going to attempt to understand the code base and make a few commits, adding documentation where I can.
        </p>
